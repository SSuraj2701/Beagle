          The <u>Beagle</u>  is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to
          the much larger foxhound. The <u>beagle</u> was developed primarily for
          hunting hare, known as <u>beagling</u>. Possessing a great sense of smell and
          superior tracking instincts, the <u>beagle</u> is the primary breed used as a
          detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in
          quarantine around the world. The  <u>beagle</u> is intelligent and is a popular
          pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health
          problems.
